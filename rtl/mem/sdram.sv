//============================================================================
//  Sega System 32 for MiSTer — SDRAM controller
//  16-bit SDR SDRAM @ clk_ram (96.6 MHz), CL2, strictly serialized
//  transactions. ROM-download writes keep a row open for same-row words and
//  explicitly precharge before row changes, reads, or refreshes.
//  Four request ports, CPU-tier-over-AV-tier priority (see the read_grant
//  comment below for why):
//    p0: V60 fetch/data (latency critical, 16-bit single)  -- CPU tier
//    p3: Z80 ROM         (16-bit single, byte laned)         -- CPU tier
//    p2: sprite fetch    (128-bit burst = 8 words)          -- AV tier
//    p4: MultiPCM        (16-bit single)                     -- AV tier
//  Write port (ROM download only): highest priority while ioctl_download.
//
//  A sixth port (p5, "V25 program ROM") existed here as leftover header text
//  copied from a sibling Sega System 32 core at this project's first commit.
//  Real System 24 hardware has no such subsystem (confirmed against a real
//  PCB schematic) and p5_req/p5_addr were only ever driven to zero -- removed
//  entirely, along with its s24_sdram_cdc bridge instance and dedicated
//  64-bit output register, to free fitter resources on an 87%-ALM design.
//
//  The p1 tile-fetch port was removed the same way: rtl/video/s24_tile.sv's
//  display path was switched to an on-chip character-RAM mirror and its
//  mem_req/mem_addr outputs were left permanently at zero (see git history
//  for the commit that made that switch) -- so p1_req never asserted on any
//  build. Removing the port drops its s24_sdram_cdc bridge (REQ_WIDTH 24,
//  RSP_WIDTH 64) and its round-robin slot. The remaining ports keep their
//  original numbers (p0, p2, p3, p4) rather than renumbering, matching how
//  p5 was dropped from the tail; the round-robin below simply skips grant
//  value 1 instead of ever assigning it.
//
//  REQUEST CONTRACT (all ports, including wr): one transaction per req
//  RISING EDGE; the address (and write data/be) is sampled on that edge.
//  A request held high is serviced exactly ONCE — a requester expecting
//  re-service per ack from a held level will hang.  Requesters must be
//  single-outstanding: drop req after (or pulse it before) each ack, and
//  produce a fresh rising edge for the next transaction.  ack is stretched
//  to 2 clk_ram cycles so clk_sys-domain requesters sample it exactly once.
