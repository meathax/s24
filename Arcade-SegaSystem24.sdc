# SDRAM board interface.
#
# Nothing in this project or in sys/sys_top.sdc previously created a clock on
# the SDRAM_CLK port, so EVERY SDRAM path -- the pin-to-IOE SDRAM_DQ capture
# into sdram.sv's dq_in, and the whole registered command/address bus -- was
# UNCONSTRAINED and silently excluded from timing analysis.  The comment at
# rtl/mem/sdram.sv:314-319 asserts these paths are covered "under the SDC
# input-delay and multicycle constraints"; they were not.
#
# The interface is source-synchronous.  pll outclk2 is clk_ram phase-shifted
# +5208 ps (rtl/pll/synthesis/submodules/pll_pll_inst.v:37-38) = exactly 180
# degrees at 96 MHz, so relative to the clk_ram edge that registers a command:
#   t=0        command/address launched by clk_ram
#   t=5.208ns  SDRAM samples it (half-period of setup)
#   t=26.04ns  CL2 data launched by SDRAM (2 SDRAM clocks later)
#   t=31.25ns  dq_in samples it (cl_pipe[3], 3 clk_ram cycles after the CAS)
#
# That model is INCOMPLETE, and the earlier claim here that "no multicycle
# exception belongs" was wrong.  It ignores the latency of SDRAM_CLK itself:
# the port is fed from outclk2 through general routing and an output buffer,
# and quartus_sta measures 13.804 ns from the PLL edge to the SDRAM_CLK PIN
# against only 7.988 ns for clk_ram reaching the dq_in capture flop -- a
# 5.29-5.82 ns skew, i.e. more than a full half-period, that the sequence
# above omits.  Once it is included the SDRAM's CL2 word cannot possibly
# arrive before the default single-cycle capture edge, and all 16
# SDRAM_DQ -> dq_in paths report about -9 ns.  Those 16 paths were the
# ENTIRE -142.306 ns TNS of the clk_ram domain and the only failing paths in
# the core; clk_ram's own Fmax is 108.45 MHz against 96.63 MHz required.
#
# The -max input delay is tAC(CL2) plus board flight for the parts on the
# MiSTer 128 MB module.
# SDRAM_CLK is driven directly from PLL outclk2 (general[2]), which the PLL
# already phase-shifts +180 degrees -- see Arcade-SegaSystem24.sv. An
# IOE-DDR-forwarded alternative was hardware-tested and reverted after it
# regressed sprite rendering on real hardware (see rtl/mem/sdram.sv's dq_in
# capture comment); source the generated clock from outclk2 directly again,
# with no additional inversion.

# s24_sdram_cdc bundled-data payloads.
#
# clk_sys and clk_ram are PLL-related and deliberately share one clock group
# above, so every payload bit between them is otherwise analysed as an ordinary
# single-cycle synchronous path. The payload registers are NOT single-cycle:
# rtl/mem/s24_sdram_cdc.sv writes req_hold/rsp_hold on the same edge that
# flips its req_toggle/rsp_toggle, and the opposite domain only samples the
# payload one clock AFTER it has observed that toggle through its synchroniser.
# The core instantiates the crossing at SYNC_STAGES(1) because the two clocks
# are an exact phase-locked 2:1 pair (VCO/26 and VCO/13), which puts the
# capture two destination-clock periods after the write in both directions:
#   request  launch clk_sys t=0      -> req_sync_m t=10.348 -> capture t=20.696
#   response launch clk_ram t=10.348 -> rsp_sync_m t=20.696 -> capture t=41.392
# i.e. 2 x 10.348 ns against clk_ram and 31.044 ns against clk_sys, exactly the
# windows the -setup -end 2 below asks for. The payload is therefore provably
# stable for at least two destination-clock periods before any capture, and is
# held until the transaction completes because the producer is gated by
# src_busy/dst_busy. Dropping to SYNC_STAGES(0) would halve both windows and
# make this exception a lie -- see that module's SYNC_STAGES comment.
#
# Without this exception the fitter inserted >2.3 us of hold-fixing routing
# delay across these buses (notably the 128-bit cdc_p2 sprite response),
# exhausted routing in that region, and still missed hold. That is a
# constraint defect, not a placement problem: seeds 3, 5 and 6 all failed the
# same way.
#
# Scope is exactly the bundled payload registers -- the toggle bits, the
# synchroniser registers, the handshake/busy flags and every other path stay
# fully timed, so the crossing's correctness still rests on the handshake
# rather than on this exception.
# Constrain these as MULTICYCLE, never false_path. The payload is genuinely
# relaxed -- but it is NOT unconstrained, and the difference matters on
# silicon. set_false_path removes every bound, so at this design's ~87%
# ALM / 86% RAM congestion the router is free to leave a payload bit
# arbitrarily slow; any bit that misses its capture edge returns corrupt
# read data, which shows up as garbage tile/sprite texture while simpler
# screens still look correct. Verilator has no routing delay and therefore
# cannot reproduce it. A hold violation on the same registers corrupts the
# data too, just for the opposite reason, so neither extreme is acceptable.
#
# clk_ram (96.6 MHz) and clk_sys (48.3 MHz) are PLL-related at exactly 2:1,
# and the handshake guarantees the payload holds for at least two
# destination-clock periods before capture (see the analysis above), so a
# 2-cycle setup with the matching 1-cycle hold adjustment is the correct
# requirement: relaxed enough to remove the hold-fixing routing delay,
# strict enough that every bit remains bounded and analysed.
