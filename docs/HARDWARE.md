# Hardware truth model

> Populate from evidence. Do not turn unknowns into implementation assumptions.

## Identity

| Field | Value | Confidence | Source |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Game / set | UNRESOLVED |  |  |
| PCB name/revision | UNRESOLVED |  |  |
| Region/clone differences | UNRESOLVED |  |  |
| MAME short name/driver | UNRESOLVED |  |  |

Confidence values: `KNOWN`, `INFERRED`, `HYPOTHESIS`.

## Evidence inventory

| ID | Evidence | Revision/location | Supports | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E001 |  |  |  |  |

## Clock tree

| Source | Frequency | Derivation | Consumers | Enable/phase | Confidence/source |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| OSC0 |  |  |  |  |  |

Document actual clocks separately from synchronous clock enables. Record reset release relation and any asynchronous boundaries.

## Processing devices

| Device | Type/revision | Clock | Bus | Reset | Interrupts | Confidence/source |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| MAIN |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Memory and address map

| Owner | Address range | Width | Device | Read/write behavior | Wait/arbitration | Confidence/source |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Record mirroring, banking, byte lanes, endian behavior, open-bus behavior, read side effects and read-during-write semantics.

## Interrupts, DMA and timers

| Source | Target/level | Trigger | Latch/ack/clear | Timing domain | Confidence/source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

For DMA record source, destination, width, trigger, ordering, busy/ack, bus stealing and completion behavior.

## Video

| Property | Value | Confidence/source |
|---|---|---|
| Master/pixel clock |  |  |
| Total/active dimensions |  |  |
| H/V blank and sync |  |  |
| Tilemap layers |  |  |
| Sprites/buffering |  |  |
| Palette format |  |  |
| Priority/mixer |  |  |
| Special effects |  |  |

Describe where registers latch: immediate, pixel, line, vblank, frame or DMA boundary.

## Audio

| Path/device | Clock/rate | Registers/bus | IRQ/timer | ROM/banking | Confidence/source |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

## Inputs, outputs and persistent state

Document controls, analog/trackball/wheel semantics, DIP switches, coin/service, lamps, watchdog, EEPROM/NVRAM and power-on defaults.

## Board/game variants

| Feature | Variant A | Variant B | RTL strategy | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

## Unknowns and experiments

| ID | Unknown | Why it matters | Smallest experiment | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| U001 |  |  |  | OPEN |

## Implementation mapping

| Hardware function | RTL module/path | Donor/source | Verification status |
|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |
